Description:
The Secure Encryption Tool is a web-based application that allows users to manually encrypt and decrypt messages using AES and DES encryption algorithms. Unlike traditional messaging apps, this tool gives users complete control over their encryption process by allowing them to input a custom passphrase.

Key Features:
âœ… User Authentication â€“ Simple sign-up and login system for secure access.
âœ… AES & DES Encryption â€“ Users can choose between AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or DES (Data Encryption Standard) for message encryption.
âœ… Manual Encryption & Decryption â€“ Encrypt messages before sharing and decrypt them with a passphrase.
âœ… Offline Functionality â€“ Works without an internet connection for encryption and decryption.
âœ… No Message Storage â€“ Ensures privacy by not storing messages after encryption.

Use Cases:
ðŸ”¹ Secure Communication â€“ Encrypt messages before sending them via email, text, or other platforms.
ðŸ”¹ Data Protection â€“ Store sensitive information in an encrypted format.
ðŸ”¹ Educational Purposes â€“ Learn about cryptographic principles through hands-on encrypt
